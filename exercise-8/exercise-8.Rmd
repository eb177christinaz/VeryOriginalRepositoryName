## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# make histograms with hist()
#barplots with barplot()
#boxplots with boxplot()
#scatteplots with plot()

hist(cocoli_dat$dbh1, xlab = "DBH in 1994(mm)", main = "Distributions of sizes in 1994", col = "green")
#xlab means label x
#main means main title


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cocoli_dat) + geom_histogram(aes(dbh1)) + geom_histogram(aes(dbh2), fill = "green", alpha = .2) + ggtitle("Distribution of sizesin 1994")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
